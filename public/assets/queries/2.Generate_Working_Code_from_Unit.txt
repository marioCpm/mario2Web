Generate a complete and practical coding tutorial from a unit's JSON description. The tutorial should consist of structured sessions that guide a beginner through the entire coding process, from setting up the environment to developing features and refining the code. Each session should contain a mix of code snippets, explanatory text, and interactive questions designed to reinforce understanding and practical application of the concepts.
please make sure the tutorial is rich, and including at least 5 sessions and at least 8 steps for each session.
